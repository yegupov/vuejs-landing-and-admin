Gennady was surprised at my impudence, but we all made it. He has his own opinion on my opinion (in our hearts we are all designers), he does not follow his lead, and this just gives an excellent result. The site was made exactly as I wanted (in terms of style, convenience), despite the fact that I really could not explain anything.  Listen to him and you will be happy! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‡ Further I plan to cooperate with Gennady. Let the professionals do it. Thanks again!!!"
