# Vue.js Landing & Admin
`Vue.js` `PUG` `SCSS` `JavaScript` `SVG` `Fake backend` `Auth` `JWT`

Web developer's [`personal portfolio site`](https://vuelanding.make-website.ru/) and admin panel developed with the Vue.js framework. The project used a fake backend to be able to work without a server (without a backend).

All data is stored in Vuex storage. Data.js has the initial state of the data: 2 users, 5 works, 5 reviews, and 3 skills.  
In the admin panel, you can perform the operations of creating, editing and deleting positions (CRUD), as well as resetting the states to the initial values.  
The repository was created just to showcase the code.
